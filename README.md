# Location-Reminder

Hello everyone!

I'm working on an Android project for location-based reminders using Kotlin and MVVM architecture. The app allows users to add a reminder along with its exact location on Google Maps. When the user saves the location, a geofence is created, and the app will notify the user when they are within a small range of the saved location.

I'm looking for collaborators who are interested in working on this project with me. Specifically, I'm looking for developers who have experience with:

  .Kotlin and MVVM architecture
  .Google Maps API and location services
  .Geofencing in Android
  
If you're interested, please don't hesitate to reach out to me! I'm excited to work with a talented team and bring this app to life.

Thanks!
